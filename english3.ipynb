    "Once upon a time there was a sweet little girl. Everyone who saw her liked her, but most of all her grandmother, who did not know what to give the child next. Once she gave her a little cap made of red velvet. Because it suited her so well, and she wanted to wear it all the time, she came to be known as Little Red Cap.\n",
    "One day her mother said to her, \"Come Little Red Cap. Here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine. Take them to your grandmother. She is sick and weak, and they will do her well. Mind your manners and give her my greetings. Behave yourself on the way, and do not leave the path, or you might fall down and break the glass, and then there will be nothing for your sick grandmother.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Little Red Cap promised to obey her mother. The grandmother lived out in the woods, a half hour from the village. When Little Red Cap entered the woods a wolf came up to her. She did not know what a wicked animal he was, and was not afraid of him.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Good day to you, Little Red Cap.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Thank you, wolf.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Where are you going so early, Little Red Cap?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"To grandmother's.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"And what are you carrying under your apron?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Grandmother is sick and weak, and I am taking her some cake and wine. We baked yesterday, and they should give her strength.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Little Red Cap, just where does your grandmother live?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Her house is a good quarter hour from here in the woods, under the three large oak trees. There's a hedge of hazel bushes there. You must know the place,\" said Little Red Cap.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wolf thought to himself, \"Now there is a tasty bite for me. Just how are you going to catch her?\" Then he said, \"Listen, Little Red Cap, haven't you seen the beautiful flowers that are blossoming in the woods? Why don't you go and take a look? And I don't believe you can hear how beautifully the birds are singing. You are walking along as though you were on your way to school in the village. It is very beautiful in the woods.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Little Red Cap opened her eyes and saw the sunlight breaking through the trees and how the ground was covered with beautiful flowers. She thought, \"If a take a bouquet to grandmother, she will be very pleased. Anyway, it is still early, and I'll be home on time.\" And she ran off into the woods looking for flowers. Each time she picked one she thought that she could see an even more beautiful one a little way off, and she ran after it, going further and further into the woods. But the wolf ran straight to the grandmother's house and knocked on the door.\n",
